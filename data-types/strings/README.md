The `strings_spec.rb` file has a number of exercises to help you better work with strings in ruby.

1. Make sure you followed the instructions listed in `README.md` in main ruby-exercises folder to install `rspec` via the bundler
1. Open `strings_spec.rb` in Atom
1. In terminal, use `rspec strings_spec.rb` to get started
  * NOTE: Test files (`example_spec.rb`) execute with `rspec` instead of the `ruby` command you are used to.
1. Carefully read the error message, edit the code in the `strings_spec.rb` file, save the file in Atom, and execute again until each test passes.
  * Remove the `x` in `xit` to enable each test as you go. Placing `skip` under the do line works similarly. Good luck!

Below is a list of methods that will help you complete the exercises - research each of them on the [Ruby Docs for Strings](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/String.html) to learn more about what they do and how they are used.

There are additional methods that you will need to complete the exercises; each of these additional methods can be found in the Ruby Docs for Strings.
